# Document Processing and Research Tool

This project is an end-to-end research tool designed to process documents, store and search document vectors, and create a multi-agent research interface. The system utilizes an Airflow pipeline to automate document processing, vector storage, and document-based Q&A capabilities.

---

## 🏆 Objective

The primary objective is to develop a research tool that:

- Parses documents and stores document vectors for similarity-based search.
- Creates a multi-agent system for document-based research.
- Provides an interactive interface for question-answering (Q&A) and research interactions.

## 🛠️ Project Components

### 1. Airflow Pipeline for Document Processing and Vector Storage

- **Document Parsing:** Uses [Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) for parsing documents and extracting text.
- **Vector Storage:** Uses [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) to store document vectors for fast, scalable similarity search.
- **Pipeline Automation:** Airflow automates the document parsing and vector storage process, integrating Docling with Pinecone.

### 2. Multi-Agent Research System

- **Agent Setup:** Uses [Langraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/introduction/) to create agents capable of:
  - **Document-based research** using processed vectors.
  - **Arxiv search** for related academic papers.
  - **Web-based search** for extended research context.
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for document-based Q&A.

### 3. Research Interface and Q/A Interaction

- **User Interface:** Developed using **Streamlit** or **Coagents** (bonus feature), allowing users to interact with document content by asking questions and retrieving answers.
- **Results Export:** Generates a professional PDF report and an instructional Codelabs document based on research findings.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>

2.	**Install Dependencies:**
	•	Ensure Python is installed, then set up a virtual environment.
	•	Install the required dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3.	**Configure Airflow:**
	•	Airflow Setup: Define and configure Airflow DAGs for document processing.
	•	Docling and Pinecone Integration: Configure Docling for document parsing and connect it with Pinecone for vector storage.


**Example Configuration:**
	•	Set up Docling configurations for parsing the dataset.
	•	Configure Pinecone API keys and environment in the Airflow pipeline settings.


4.	**Run the Pipeline:**
	•	Start the Airflow server to initiate the pipeline:

  bash
  airflow webserver -p 8080
  airflow scheduler

  •	Trigger the pipeline DAG to begin document parsing and vector storage in Pinecone.

5	**Launch the Research Interface:**
	•	Run the research interface using Streamlit (or Coagents, if configured) for user interaction:

streamlit run app.py
	•	Access the interactive Q&A and research tools from the interface.

💻 Usage
1. Document Processing:
• The Airflow pipeline automates the parsing of documents, storing them as vectors in Pinecone for similarity search.
2. Research Interaction:
• Select processed documents for research.
• Interact with agents to conduct Arxiv searches, retrieve additional web context, and use the RAG model for Q&A on document content.
3. Results Export:
• Export findings as a PDF report and structure them into a Codelabs document for future reference.
